Regionname.txt are lists of the SUFI's in each region that are 100% paper roads to ensure we can filter these from LINZ data comparisons.

No requirements on the formatting as long as the SUFI is the first entry in each line (refer Wellington example).
It is helpful to add other information - a suggested format is:
Sufi, Roadname, Area, Date/Time deleted.

RegionnamePaperNumbers are lists of Addresses that exist in the LINZ database as addresses, but do not actually exist. 
Adding addresses to this list prevents a number checking program from flagging these addresses as an error.
This would typically be done where the natural place for the address would be on a piece of unformed/paper road.
