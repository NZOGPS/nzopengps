Legal Notes


    * The NZ Open GPS maps are distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    * The NZ Open GPS maps are free software. Any distrubution of it must be for free and at cost of media, packaging and shipping only. No 'finders' or 'research' fee may be charged for this maps distribution.
    * The content of this website (i.e. the pages and images) may not be copied / reproduced.
    * If you use these maps in any way (including any TradeMe GPS sellers who pre-load onto GPS units or provide the maps on CD along with the purchase of a GPS unit), please give "NZ Open GPS Maps Project" credit, and I'd also appreciate some feedback and which model of GPS you have so I can build up a list of hardware these maps work with
    * Now would be a good time to point out a few things: the data may not be 100% accurate. Don't blame me if you get lost! The normal navigation resources should be always used e.g. maps / charts / compass / local advise etc.
    * The geographic points of interest data is known to be slightly inaccurate as it was developed from points manually read from paper maps by LINZ...it is good enough for regional locations, just don't expect accuracy down to a couple of meters Wink

Most road data for this project has been sourced and purchased from Ollivier & Co. with lessor amounts from the LINZ topo-online website extracted between 2003 onwards, and the old Beca / Transit highways centerline dataset. There are also many user submitted tracklogs and feedback that has been used to further develop the maps. See the 'Maps' forums for more information.

Other Data Sources:


    * POI for the commercial elements (i.e. business locations) have been sourced from the www.Zenbu.co.nz project with the help of both members here (RC, Cloggy) and Zenbu's team.
    * POI for the non-commercial elements (i.e. parks, huts, hotsprings etc) is derived from multiple sources including LINZ, Geoff's modified dataset, lots of feedback and help from individuals (Sean, Peter, Aaron, TGSnoopy and many, many others - sorry if I have forgotten your names here! But there have been many over the years)
